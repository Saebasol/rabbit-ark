## Description

This program is inspired by [YouTube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/) and [Hitomi Downloader](https://github.com/KurtBestor/Hitomi-Downloader)

The download is processed using the [aiomultiprocess](https://github.com/omnilib/aiomultiprocess) module.

### Download

You can Download in [here](https://github.com/Saebasol/rabbit-ark/releases)

### How to use

First you should specify which extractor to use

```sh
rabbitark pixiv
```

Then provide downloadable information, such as a link, via the --downloadable argument.

```sh

rabbitark pixiv --downloadable pixiv-artwork-url
```

After a while, you can see that the folder is created and the images are down.

For more information, check the -h argument.
